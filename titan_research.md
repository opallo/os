### [Optical Constants of Titan Haze Analogue from 0.4 to 3.5 Î¼m:
  Determined Using Vacuum Spectroscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08521v1)

Titan's thick atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen and methane.
Complex chemistry happening in Titan's atmosphere produces optically thick
organic hazes. These hazes play significant roles in Titan's atmosphere and on
its surface, and their optical properties are crucial for understanding many
processes happening on Titan. Due to the lack of such information, the optical
constants of laboratory prepared Titan haze analogues are essential inputs for
atmospheric modeling and data analysis of remote sensing observations of Titan.
Here, we perform laboratory simulations in a Titan relevant environment,
analyze the resulting Titan haze analogues using vacuum Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, and calculate the optical constants from the measured
transmittance and reflectance spectra. We provide a reliable set of optical
constants of Titan haze analogue in the wavelength range from 0.4 to 3.5 micron
and will extend to 28.5 micron in the near future, which can both be used for
analyzing existing and future observational data of Titan. This study
establishes a feasible method to determine optical constants of haze analogues
of (exo)planetary bodies.

### [Titan Magnetic Tail: Does its Configuration correspond to the Induced
  Magnetosphere?](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3729v1)

Magnetic field structure observed in numerous Cassini flybys in the region of
Titan interaction with the corotating flow of Kronian magnetosheric plasma
contradicts the classical picture of the ideal induced magnetosphere produced
by the magnetic field line draping about the obstacle. Clear draping is
observed only upstream the Titan, but not in the Titan magnetic wake. We
consider the magnetic field tension downstream the Titan magnetic tail and show
that the magnetic field direction is not consistent with the induced
magnetosphere produced by magnetic field lines draping. We arrive at the
conclusion that the mechanisms alternative to the induced magnetosphere
formation should be considered for the Titan magnetic surrounding.

### [ADEPT Drag Modulation Aerocapture: Applications for Future Titan
  Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10412v1)

The Cassini-Huygens mission has transformed our understanding of Titan from a
hazy veiled moon to a place surprisingly like the Earth, with terrestrial
physical processes such as wind, rainfall, and erosion shaping the landscape
albeit with entirely different chemistry and temperatures. Dragonfly, a single
element mission which fits within the New Frontiers cost cap will arrive at
Titan in 2034, and perform in-situ investigations of the organic materials on
the surface. However, its detailed investigations will be limited to region
within its short flight range. The big gaps in our understanding of Titan
global topography, climate, and upper atmospheric chemistry which can only
investigated from an orbiter around Titan will remain to be addressed by a
future orbiter mission. Due to the challenges of attaining orbit, past Titan
orbiter concepts have been beyond the New Frontiers cost cap. The present study
explores the use of drag modulation aerocapture for a Titan Orbiter which fits
within New Frontiers. The study shows how a Dragonfly-like lander, and a Titan
orbiter which each individually fit within the New Frontiers cost cap, when
combined together can provide the science data return equivalent to a
Flagship-class mission.

### [Abundance Measurements of Titan's Stratospheric HCN, HC$_3$N,
  C$_3$H$_4$, and CH$_3$CN from ALMA Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10873v1)

Previous investigations have employed more than 100 close observations of
Titan by the Cassini orbiter to elucidate connections between the production
and distribution of Titan's vast, organic-rich chemical inventory and its
atmospheric dynamics. However, as Titan transitions into northern summer, the
lack of incoming data from the Cassini orbiter presents a potential barrier to
the continued study of seasonal changes in Titan's atmosphere. In our previous
work (Thelen et al., 2018), we demonstrated that the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is well suited for measurements of
Titan's atmosphere in the stratosphere and lower mesosphere (~100-500 km)
through the use of spatially resolved (beam sizes &lt;1'') flux calibration
observations of Titan. Here, we derive vertical abundance profiles of four of
Titan's trace atmospheric species from the same 3 independent spatial regions
across Titan's disk during the same epoch (2012 to 2015): HCN, HC$_3$N,
C$_3$H$_4$, and CH$_3$CN. We find that Titan's minor constituents exhibit large
latitudinal variations, with enhanced abundances at high latitudes compared to
equatorial measurements; this includes CH$_3$CN, which eluded previous
detection by Cassini in the stratosphere, and thus spatially resolved abundance
measurements were unattainable. Even over the short 3-year period, vertical
profiles and integrated emission maps of these molecules allow us to observe
temporal changes in Titan's atmospheric circulation during northern spring. Our
derived abundance profiles are comparable to contemporary measurements from
Cassini infrared observations, and we find additional evidence for subsidence
of enriched air onto Titan's south pole during this time period. Continued
observations of Titan with ALMA beyond the summer solstice will enable further
study of how Titan's atmospheric composition and dynamics respond to seasonal
changes.

### [Dissolution on Titan and on Earth: Towards the age of Titan's karstic
  landscapes](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.08109v1)

Titan's polar surface is dotted with hundreds of lacustrine depressions.
Based on the hypothesis that they are karstic in origin, we aim at determining
the efficiency of surface dissolution as a landshaping process on Titan, in a
comparative planetology perspective with the Earth as reference. Our approach
is based on the calculation of solutional denudation rates and allow inference
of formation timescales for topographic depressions developed by chemical
erosion on both planetary bodies. The model depends on the solubility of solids
in liquids, the density of solids and liquids, and the average annual net
rainfall rates. We compute and compare the denudation rates of pure solid
organics in liquid hydrocarbons and of minerals in liquid water over Titan and
Earth timescales. We then investigate the denudation rates of a superficial
organic layer in liquid methane over one Titan year. At this timescale, such a
layer on Titan would behave like salts or carbonates on Earth depending on its
composition, which means that dissolution processes would likely occur but
would be 30 times slower on Titan compared to the Earth due to the seasonality
of precipitation. Assuming an average depth of 100 m for Titan's lacustrine
depressions, these could have developed in a few tens of millions of years at
polar latitudes higher than 70{\deg} N and S, and a few hundreds of million
years at lower polar latitudes. The ages determined are consistent with the
youth of the surface (&lt;1 Gyr) and the repartition of dissolution-related
landforms on Titan.
