| Generative AI-enabled Blockchain Networks: Fundamentals, Applications, and Case Study | Cong T. Nguyen | Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has recently emerged as a promising solution to address critical challenges of blockchain technology, including scalability, security, privacy, and interoperability. In this paper, we first introduce GAI techniques, outline their applications, and discuss existing solutions for integrating GAI into blockchains. Then, we discuss emerging solutions that demonstrate the effectiveness of GAI in addressing various challenges of blockchain, such as detecting unknown blockchain attacks and smart contract vulnerabilities, designing key secret sharing schemes, and enhancing privacy. Moreover, we present a case study to demonstrate that GAI, specifically the generative diffusion model, can be employed to optimize blockchain network performance metrics. Experimental results clearly show that, compared to a baseline traditional AI approach, the proposed generative diffusion model approach can converge faster, achieve higher rewards, and significantly improve the throughput and latency of the blockchain network. Additionally, we highlight future research directions for GAI in blockchain applications, including personalized GAI-enabled blockchains, GAI-blockchain synergy, and privacy and security considerations within blockchain ecosystems. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15625v1) |
| How to Not Get Caught When You Launder Money on Blockchain? | Cuneyt G. Akcora | The number of blockchain users has tremendously grown in recent years. As an unintended consequence, e-crime transactions on blockchains has been on the rise. Consequently, public blockchains have become a hotbed of research for developing AI tools to detect and trace users and transactions that are related to e-crime. We argue that following a few select strategies can make money laundering on blockchain virtually undetectable with most of the existing tools and algorithms. As a result, the effective combating of e-crime activities involving cryptocurrencies requires the development of novel analytic methodology in AI. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15082v1) |
| A Survey of Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence for 6G Wireless Communications | Yiping Zuo | The research on the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications for the development of future mobile communication networks has been officially launched around the world. 6G networks face multifarious challenges, such as resource-constrained mobile devices, difficult wireless resource management, high complexity of heterogeneous network architectures, explosive computing and storage requirements, privacy and security threats. To address these challenges, deploying blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in 6G networks may realize new breakthroughs in advancing network performances in terms of security, privacy, efficiency, cost, and more. In this paper, we provide a detailed survey of existing works on the application of blockchain and AI to 6G wireless communications. More specifically, we start with a brief overview of blockchain and AI. Then, we mainly review the recent advances in the fusion of blockchain and AI, and highlight the inevitable trend of deploying both blockchain and AI in wireless communications. Furthermore, we extensively explore integrating blockchain and AI for wireless communication systems, involving secure services and Internet of Things (IoT) smart applications. Particularly, some of the most talked-about key services based on blockchain and AI are introduced, such as spectrum management, computation allocation, content caching, and security and privacy. Moreover, we also focus on some important IoT smart applications supported by blockchain and AI, covering smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart grid, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We also analyze the open issues and research challenges for the joint deployment of blockchain and AI in 6G wireless communications. Lastly, based on lots of existing meaningful works, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of blockchain and AI in 6G networks. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08604v2) |
| AI-Protected Blockchain-based IoT environments: Harnessing the Future of Network Security and Privacy | Ali Mohammadi Ruzbahani | Integrating blockchain technology with the Internet of Things offers transformative possibilities for enhancing network security and privacy in the contemporary digital landscape, where interconnected devices and expansive networks are ubiquitous. This paper explores the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in bolstering blockchain-enabled IoT systems, potentially marking a significant leap forward in safeguarding data integrity and confidentiality across networks. Blockchain technology provides a decentralized and immutable ledger, ideal for the secure management of device identities and transactions in IoT networks. When coupled with AI, these systems gain the ability to not only automate and optimize security protocols but also adaptively respond to new and evolving cyber threats. This dual capability enhances the resilience of networks against cyber-attacks, a critical consideration as IoT devices increasingly permeate critical infrastructures. The synergy between AI and blockchain in IoT is profound. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data from IoT devices to detect patterns and anomalies that may signify security breaches. Concurrently, blockchain can ensure that data records are tamper-proof, enhancing the reliability of AI-driven security measures. Moreover, this research evaluates the implications of AI-enhanced blockchain systems on privacy protection within IoT networks. IoT devices often collect sensitive personal data, making privacy a paramount concern. AI can facilitate the development of new protocols that ensure data privacy and user anonymity without compromising the functionality of IoT systems. Through comprehensive analysis and case studies, this paper aims to provide an in-depth understanding of how AI-enhanced blockchain technology can revolutionize network security and privacy in IoT environments. | [Link](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13847v1) |
