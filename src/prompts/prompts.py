# Tool: Add Numbers

def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    
    # Adds two integers.

    # Parameters:
    #    a (int): The first number.
    #    b (int): The second number.

    # Returns:
    #    int: The sum of the two numbers.
    # Example Usage:
    # add_numbers(1, 2)
    # ---

    CODE HERE

The code should always annotate the return type as well as have debug messages like "task success", or "xyz error".
